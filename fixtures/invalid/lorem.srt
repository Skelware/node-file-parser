02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,200
Gandalf!

1312
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:22,200 X1:69 X2:666 Y1:69 Y2:666
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1313
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:27,000
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

1314
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:39,100
Go back to the Shadow.

1315
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,200
You - shall not - pass!

1316
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:22,200
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1317
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,400
Fly, you fools!

1318
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:38,700
No!

1319
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:47,000
Aragorn!

1320
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:47,200
Legolas, get them up.

1321
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:53,100
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1322
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:56,900
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

1323
02:28:57,300 --> 02:29:00,400
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1324
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:04,700
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1325
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,500
On your feet, Sam.

1326
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:10,300
Frodo?

1327
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,000
Frodo!

1328
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:09,000
Stay close, young hobbits!
